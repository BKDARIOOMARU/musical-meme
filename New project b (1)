This process conceptually utilizes an AI/ML model to interpret genre, mood, and style from the prompt.\n","*   **Dynamic Vocal Synthesis**: It can generate synthetic vocals from provided lyrical text. Crucially, the vocal style is adaptable and can match the generated music's genre and mood, offering stylistic nuances (e.g., \"vocal\\_style\\_for\\_pop\\_energetic\" or \"vocal\\_style\\_for\\_classical\\_calm\").\n","*   **Intelligent Instrumentation**: The app orchestrates and generates instrumental tracks by selecting appropriate instruments based on the song's genre and style (e.g., 'Strings', 'Piano', 'Woodwinds' for classical; 'Synthesizer', 'Drums', 'Bass', 'Electric Guitar' for pop). These instrumental parts are conceptually created to complement the generated melody and vocals.\n","*   **Comprehensive Playlist Management**: Users can save, organize, and manage their generated songs through a dedicated playlist system. This system allows for adding, removing, reordering, and conceptually playing tracks within custom playlists. Each song is uniquely identified and stores its musical parameters, vocal data, instrumental data, and a placeholder for the full audio mix.\n","*   **User-Friendly Interface (Conceptual)**: The proposed user interface design includes clear input fields for text prompts and lyrics, controls to initiate music generation, and an intuitive section for managing playlists, including options to view, create, add to, or remove from playlists.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   The current design is highly conceptual, relying on placeholder functions and simulated AI/ML models. The immediate next step should be to research and integrate actual music generation AI/ML frameworks, robust text-to-speech engines, and digital audio workstation (DAW) integration or audio synthesis libraries to realize the described functionalities.\n","*   Develop the actual user interface based on the conceptual outline, ensuring a smooth user experience for prompt input, song generation, and comprehensive playlist management, including visual feedback for generation progress and song playback.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"f0756f9e"},"source":["# Task\n","Summarize the capabilities of the envisioned music creation application, named \"Music Creation Wanda,\" focusing on its ability to generate full songs with vocals and instrumentation from text prompts and manage these songs via a playlist."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"10dd18e1"},"source":["## Execute Example\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Execute the modified code cell to demonstrate the `generate_music_from_text` function with an example prompt.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8fa634e6"},"source":["## Summary:\n","\n","### Q&A\n","*   **What are the capabilities of the envisioned music creation application, \"Music Creation Wanda,\" based on the provided solving process?**\n","    The current solving process focuses on demonstrating a `generate_music_from_text` function, indicating an ability to create music from textual prompts.
