### Full Description
**Transform Your Ideas Into Music**

AI Music Generator lets you instantly create original instrumental tracks, convert lyrics to sung vocals, and explore random musical compositions—all in your pocket.

**Features:**
- 🎹 Instrumental Synthesis – Generate melodies from text prompts with customizable tempo (60–160 BPM), genre (Electronic, Pop, Classical, Hip-Hop, Ambient), and duration
- 🎤 Lyrics to Vocals – Turn any text into sung vocals using AI-powered text-to-speech with pitch modulation
- 🎲 Random Mode – Discover unexpected musical ideas with procedurally generated compositions
- ⚙️ Full Control – Adjust tempo, duration, sample rate, and seed for reproducible results
- 📥 Download – Export your creations as WAV or MP3 files
- ⚡ Fast Preview – Quick cached generation for rapid iteration and experimentation

**Perfect For:**
- Musicians exploring new ideas
- Content creators seeking royalty-free background music
- Anyone curious about AI-generated audio
- Music enthusiasts and hobbyists

**How It Works:**
The app uses harmonic synthesis with attack/sustain/release envelopes, percussive beats, light reverb, and local text-to-speech. Results are deterministic and reproducible using seed-based generation.

**Note:** This is a demo/prototype synthesizer optimized for quick creative exploration, not production-grade music software.
